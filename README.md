This is a simple "Hello Word" program that I created with the MIT Scratch system for teaching little kids to program.

I was tired of my kids wasting their minds with playing games on smart phone.
I bought the book entitled [Help Your Kids with Computer Coding](https://books.google.com/books?id=iorEAwAAQBAJ) at
the Boston Children's Museum. 

The book has two parts. The first part introduces the Scratch system, which is available
on-line. If you use the Mac or a Windows system, you can download it two your system.
If you use Ubuntu, you can only use it on-line.

I created a little program that that first thinks "Hello World" and then says "Hello World"
from my own custom icon.

I read through the Scratch system of the book. It only takes a few minutes.
Then I went to [http://scratch.mit.edu](http://scratch.mit.edu), joined to create
a Scratch account, uploaded a picture to become a sprite, ![Image](scratch-src/1.png)

created a short script
program to think and to say, "Hello World!", named the project, shared it, and
saved it my computer, unzipped with a bash script I created, imported the 
zipped and unzipped project into Intellij, and the exported the project to 
GitHub, where the project can be found at 
[https://github.com/MartilloInventor/scratch-helloworld](https://github.com/MartilloInventor/scratch-helloworld).

Now I will see if I can get my kids to read the book and experiment with
the Scratch system while I try to create Scratch versions of the
simple programs that I wrote when I was in lower school back in the 60s.

I am not sure my programs will interest my kids. They seem to consider the
ways in which I learn to be incredibly boring.

I am open to suggestions.
